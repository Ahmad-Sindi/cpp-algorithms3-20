# Algorithm Challenge #20 – Palindrome Matrix (Level 3)

🧮 **Problem Description**
-
This program checks whether a 3×3 matrix is **palindrome**.

A matrix is considered palindrome if each row reads the same
from left to right and from right to left.

This challenge applies the palindrome concept to **2D structures**,
not just strings or numbers.

---

💡 **What You’ll Learn**
-
- Applying the palindrome concept beyond strings
- Using symmetric comparison (two-pointer technique)
- Understanding matrix symmetry
- Reducing unnecessary comparisons using early termination
- Writing efficient and readable matrix algorithms

---

🧩 **Example**
-
**Matrix:**

1 7 1

5 5 5

8 2 8


**Output:**
Yes: Matrix is Palindrome.

📂 **File Information**
-
- **Language:** C++
- **File Name:** palindrome_matrix.cpp
- **Challenge Number:** #20
- **Level:** 3

---

💬 **Notes**
-
This challenge builds upon previous matrix traversal problems,
but introduces **symmetry and reflection** as the main engineering idea.

Instead of scanning or aggregating values, the algorithm verifies
structural equality across mirrored positions.
